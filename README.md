# The Snake Game


Bahcesehir University CMP1001 Introduction to Programming (C++) Term Project

You are expected to implement a simple C++ game with following scenario:
You  are  controlling a  snake  and  you  need  to  eat  all  foods  but  there  are  non-food items inside the game. If you eat all food, you can finish the level. There are 2 levels to finish game. Each level must be different design.

Minimum Criteria:
You are expected to design the game by using C++. Below are the minimal criteria:  

• You must create game board with 2-Dimensional Matrix

• All food and non-food create with randomly in the game board

• All non-foods have got the same value. If you eat any non-food, game score must be decrease.

• You must use pointer for creating and using snake. Snake must be shown with numbers and when snake eat foods, numbers must be increase.

• When the game finish, you must show high-score.

• For moving snake, you need to take coordinate from user and you need to write proper control statements.

• You must use functions for drawing game board and changing snake values. If you need extra functions, you can use it. 

• When snake hit any wall, game is over and you need to show high score. 

In this project,  you  must  do  all  minimum  criteria.  In the  end,  your  program  must  be  work without any errors.
